# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. 

Problem Statement:
You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers.
The main types of attributes are:
  Demographics (age, gender etc.)
  Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
  Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)
  Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not.
  So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that   the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned. With 21 predictor variables we need to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom     provider or not.

Data:
Data is available is three csv files and a data dictionary is provided to define/explain all the variables.
